## abapGitServer
Git server implemented in ABAP

Scope:
- Web interface: browse/create repository
- No tags, no submodules, no blame
- A lot of code from abapGit can be reused
- Install via abapGit
- As SICF service
- Currently 7.50 is required, backport is planned
- abapGit must be installed as ZABAPGIT report for abapGitServer to work
- Only tested with abapGit as client, support for normal git clients is planned
