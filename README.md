# idea, coding not started

# abapGitServer
Git server implemented in ABAP

Scope:
- Limited to work with abapGit, later it can be extended to work with "real" git clients
- Web interface: browse/create repository
- No brances, no tags, no submodules, no blame
- A lot of code from abapGit can be reused, but I'd like to keep the codebase/projects separated
- Install via abapGit
- As SICF service
